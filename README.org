* Keyboards

I'm currently using:
1. [[https://github.com/tzcl/zmk-config][rae-dux]] with Kailh choc reds
2. [[https://github.com/tzcl/keyboards/tree/kbd67][KBD67 Lite R2]] with Akko matcha greens
3. [[https://github.com/tzcl/keyboards/tree/crkbd][crkbd v3]] with Gateron yellows

If you're building a keyboard using the [[https://github.com/zykrah/fuyu][Fuyu PCB]], I've
uploaded the VIAL firmware to [[https://github.com/tzcl/keyboards/tree/fuyu][fuyu]].
