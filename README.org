** Features
1. Home row mods -- really comfy, although I have issues rolling with my pinkies
2. Repeat key (still getting used to it)
3. Caps word for typing identifiers like =THIS_IS_A_CONSTANT=
4. OLED graphics
   1. OS logo
   2. [[https://github.com/HellSingCoder/qmk_firmware/tree/master/keyboards/sofle/keymaps/helltm][Luna by HellTM]]
   3. Active layer
   4. WPM counter
5. [[https://youtu.be/7f3usatOIKM?t=268][RGB matrix solid reactive multiwide]] for a cool effect when I type

** Layout
Put =keymapviz= here.

Base layer:
+ Colemak Mod-DH

Symbol layer:
+ Inspired by Getreuer's symbol layer as most of my programming is in C++/Scheme/Clojure (and soon JavaScript)
+ I used to have my brackets like the Seniply layout because when working in IDEs, normally they will insert the closing bracket for you. However, I found that being able to roll both brackets to be important.

Number layer:
+ Inspired by Pnohty's numpad+, I reversed the order of the numbers so the lowest digits are in the most comfortable positions (following Benford's law)
+ Function keys are on the right hand, on Mac, these send the "actions" by default instead of the actual function keys (e.g., volume up/down are sent when you hit F11/F12)

Nav layer:
+ Kept Vim =hjkl= since some modes in Emacs use them as keybindings instead of the arrow keys (however, I'm just learning to where those keys are in the base layer)

** Compiling and flashing
These files should go into your =qmk_firmware= directory, under =qmk_firware/keyboards/crkbd/keymaps=,
#+begin_src sh
git clone --single-branch -b crkbd git@github.com:tzcl/keyboards.git ~/projects/qmk_firmware/keyboards/crkbd/keymaps/tzcl
#+end_src

To compile the keymap, the command is
#+begin_src sh
qmk compile -kb crkbd/rev1/common -km tzcl
#+end_src
and you can flash it using =qmk flash= or [[https://github.com/qmk/qmk_toolbox/releases][QMK Toolbox]].
