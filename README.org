** Layout
** Compiling and flashing
These files should go into your =qmk_firmware= directory, under =qmk_firware/keyboards/crkbd/keymaps=,
#+begin_src sh
git clone --single-branch -b crkbd git@github.com:tzcl/keyboards.git ~/projects/qmk_firmware/keyboards/crkbd/keymaps/tzcl
#+end_src

To compile the keymap, the command is
#+begin_src sh
qmk compile -kb crkbd/rev1/common -km tzcl
#+end_src
and you can flash it using =qmk flash= or [[https://github.com/qmk/qmk_toolbox/releases][QMK Toolbox]].
