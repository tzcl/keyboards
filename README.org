* Keyboards

I'm currently using:
1. [[https://github.com/tzcl/zmk-config][rae-dux]] with Kailh choc reds
2. [[https://github.com/tzcl/keyboards/tree/kbd67][KBD67 Lite R2]] with Akko matcha greens
3. [[https://github.com/tzcl/keyboards/tree/crkbd][crkbd v3]] with Gateron yellows

If you're building a keyboard using the [[Fuyu PCB][https://github.com/zykrah/fuyu]], I've
uploaded the firmware to [[fuyu][http:s//github.com/tzcl/keyboards/tree/fuyu]].
