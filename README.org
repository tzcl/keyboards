* Keyboards

I'm currently using:
1. [[https://github.com/tzcl/zmk-config][rae-dux]] with Kailh choc reds
2. [[https://github.com/tzcl/keyboards/tree/kbd67][KBD67 Lite R2]] with Akko matcha greens
3. [[https://github.com/tzcl/keyboards/tree/crkbd][crkbd v3]] with Gateron yellows

At some point, I plan to use [[https://github.com/kmonad/kmonad][kmonad]] to customise my laptop keyboards.
