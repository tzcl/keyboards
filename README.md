# Firmware for the Fuyu PCB

![Fuyu/TKRielle](https://i.imgur.com/nOed4PF.jpg)

See my [build guide](https://tzcl.me/blog/fuyu-tkl) to see how to build a 
keyboard with this PCB.

You can use this firmware by connecting the PCB to your computer and dropping 
the `.uf2` file into the `RPI-RP2` device that pops up.
